# Play-to-Earn-Game-Smart-Contract
I'd be happy to write a Solidity smart contract for a Play-to-Earn game. I'll create a basic contract with core functionality that allows players to earn rewards for their achievements in the game.

This Play-to-Earn game smart contract provides the essential functionality needed for a blockchain-based gaming reward system. Here's what the contract does:

### Key Features:

1. **Player Registration**: Players must register before participating in the game ecosystem.

2. **Experience and Leveling System**: 
   - Players earn experience points for in-game achievements
   - Experience leads to level-ups, which increase reward rates
   - Level-up occurs when players reach level Ã— 100 experience points

3. **Daily Reward System**:
   - Players earn tokens based on their level and time elapsed
   - Higher levels earn proportionally more rewards
   - Cooldown period of 1 day between reward claims

### Functions:

1. **registerPlayer()**: Allows new players to join the ecosystem with a starting level of 1.

2. **addExperience(address player, uint256 experiencePoints)**: Only callable by the contract owner (game server), awards experience to players for their achievements, and handles level-up logic.

3. **claimRewards()**: Allows players to claim their earned tokens, with rewards scaling based on level and time since last claim.

The contract uses OpenZeppelin's standard libraries for security:
- ERC20 interface for the reward token
- Ownable for access control
- ReentrancyGuard to prevent potential exploits

Would you like me to explain any particular aspect of this contract in more detail?
